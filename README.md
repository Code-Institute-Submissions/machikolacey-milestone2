Project Example Idea 1
Create a site that calls on the Google Maps API and/or the Google Places API (or similar) to allow users to search for their next holiday destination.

External userâ€™s goal:
Find the best holiday destination for their needs.

Site owner's goal:
Get users to choose a travel package from this site and/or from its sponsors.

Potential features to include:
Connect to an API that suits your needs, we recommend Programmable Web as a way to search for APIs.

Display information about different cities that are potential holiday destinations.

Allow users to select/search a city and see a map with relevant attractions, accommodations and restaurants.

Provide results in a manner that is visually appealing and user friendly.
