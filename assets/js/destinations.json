      "body": "A wholesome, healthy and homemade food lover's retreat. Nestled away from the action of Kemptown, you may be surprised at how busy this quirky little cafe is, but with peeled back walls and upcycled features including an old sink as a salad bar and tin cans for display stands, it’s hard to miss. And you’ll be spoilt for choice at the cafeteria-style counter that’s teeming with delicious quiches, sandwiches, salads and cakes - all prepared in their open plan kitchen. The staff clearly enjoy their work together, which creates a real sense of harmony and a warm welcome."

It quickly became popular, and had become a frequently-visited theatre and entertainment venue by 1911. Aside from closures owing to war, it continued to hold regular entertainment up to the 1970s. The theatre was damaged in 1973 and following a buy-out was demolished in 1986, changing the pier's character from seaside entertainment to an amusement park, with various fairground rides and roller coasters."
